repache
=======

repache replays apache log files by creating actual tcp connections with
original timing and source ip. Therefore a simple tcp-stack was included that
handles the tcp connections in promiscuous mode. For correct work, one has to
ensure that the response packets are routed to the host at which repache is
running. Therefore repache cannot used in arbitrary network infrastructures.
